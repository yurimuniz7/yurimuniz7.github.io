In this work, we consider the influence of a cosmic string background in the spontaneous emission of an excited atom. We start by computing the one-photon spontaneous emission rate of a quantum emitter, which is a narrow band process, and then we analyze the more complex case of the two-photon spontaneous emission, which is a broadband and much richer phenomenon. In the former case, we analyze not only the behavior of the decay rate with the distance from the atom to the string, but also with the deficit angle associated with the cosmic string metric. In the latter case, we show that the spectral distribution of the emitted photons is substantially affected by the cosmic string background.\n","tags":["Spontaneous emission","Two-photon","Cosmic strings"],"title":"Two-photon spontaneous emission of an atom in a cosmic string background","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuri Muniz","P.

We demonstrate efficient, enhanced generation of two-plasmon entangled states in SWCNTs due to the strong coupling between tunable guided plasmons and the quantum emitter. We predict two-plasmon emission rates more than twelve orders of magnitude higher than in free space, with average lifetimes of a few dozen nanoseconds. Given their low dimensionality, these systems could be more efficient for generating and detecting entangled plasmons in comparison to extended graphene. Indeed, we achieve a tunable spectrum of emission in GCWs, where sharp resonances occur precisely at the plasmons' minimum excitation frequencies. We show that by changing the material properties of the GCW's dielectric core, one could tailor the dominant modes and frequencies of the emitted entangled plasmons while keeping the decay rate ten orders of magnitude higher than in free space. By unveiling the unique properties of two-plasmon spontaneous emission processes in the presence of low-dimensional carbon-based nanomaterials, our findings set the basis for a novel material platform with applications to on-chip quantum information technologies.\n","tags":["Plasmonics","Quantum optics","Spontaneous emission","Graphene","Carbon nanotubes"],"title":"Entangled two-plasmon generation in carbon nanotubes and graphene-coated wires","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuri Muniz","C.

We unravel these TPSE channels and show how their distinct Fano and Lorentzian spectral line-shapes provide a fingerprint to resolve photon-photon and photon-plasmon pathways via standard far-field single-photon spectroscopy measurements. We further show customization of the emitted two-quanta spectrum by actively tailoring the nanostructures’ optical response. We demonstrate that single photon generation via two-quanta photonic transitions can be orders of magnitude more efficient than standard one-photon spontaneous emission due to the high amplification of the photon-plasmon decay channel offered by the dark-modes supported in the nanostructure. The enormous field confinement of our ultrathin nanostructures also severely impacts the usual unbalance between one- and two-quanta emission rates, allowing the latter to be competitive with the former.\n","tags":null,"title":"Tailoring two-photon spontaneous emission using atomically thin plasmonic nanostructures","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Yuri Muniz","F.

O fenômeno consiste no decaimento de um emissor quântico excitado (por exemplo átomos ou moléculas), mesmo quando ele está isolado de todos os outros corpos no Universo, pela emissão de um ou mais fótons. Trata-se de um fenômeno cuja explicação mais adequada se dá no contexto da eletrodinâmica quântica (EDQ). Em 1946, Edward Mills Purcell mostrou que, ao contrário do que se imaginava na época, o tempo de vida de um emissor não é uma propriedade intrínseca do emissor, mas pode ser substancialmente alterado pela presença de corpos na vizinhança do mesmo. Por esse motivo, a influência de corpos na taxa de EE ficou conhecida como efeito Purcell. Esta dissertação tem como objetivo fazer uma revisão detalhada sobre EE de um fóton e o efeito Purcell, além de fazer um estudo de base do efeito Purcell na EE de dois fótons (EEDF), assunto muito pouco explorado na literatura.\n","tags":["Eletrodinâmica quântica","Emissão espontânea","Emissão de dois fótons","Efeito Purcell"],"title":"Efeito Purcell na emissão espontânea de um e dois fótons (Master thesis)","type":"publication"}]
