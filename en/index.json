Single photons—the most elementary states of light—can be generated on demand in atomic and solid state emitters. Two-photon states are also key quantum assets, but achieving them in individual emitters is challenging because their generation rate is much slower than competing one-photon processes. We demonstrate that atomically thin plasmonic nanostructures can harness two-photon spontaneous emission, resulting in giant far field two-photon production, a wealth of resonant modes enabling tailored photonic and plasmonic entangled states, and plasmon-assisted single-photon creation orders of magnitude more efficient than standard one-photon emission. We unravel the two-photon spontaneous emission channels and show that their spectral line shapes emerge from an intricate interplay between Fano and Lorentzian resonances. Enhanced two-photon spontaneous emission in two-dimensional nanostructures paves the way to an alternative efficient source of light-matter entanglement for on-chip quantum information processing and free-space quantum communications.\n","tags":["Plasmonics","Quantum optics","Spontaneous emission","Graphene","Nanostructures","Two-dimensional materials"],"title":"Two-Photon Spontaneous Emission in Atomically Thin Plasmonic Nanostructures","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1594425600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594425600,"objectID":"98a8166e479bb581e189f166ffe96fef","permalink":"/en/project/kaggle_house_prices/","publishdate":"2020-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/kaggle_house_prices/","section":"project","summary":"Getting started competition on the famous example of predicting the price of a house given a sample of labeled data.","tags":["kaggle"],"title":"Predicting house prices","type":"project"},{"authors":["Yuri Muniz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1583107200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583107200,"objectID":"4474b810b3ab5ce86bd3b7d69bd1411a","permalink":"/en/talk/zaragoza2020/","publishdate":"2020-03-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/talk/zaragoza2020/","section":"talk","summary":"The ability to harness light-matter interactions at the few-photon level plays a pivotal role in quantum technologies. Two-photon states are key quantum assets, but achieving them in individual emitters is challenging because their generation rate is much slower than competing one-photon processes. In this work, we show how atomically thin, finite-sized plasmonic nanostructures can harness two-photon spontaneous emission (TPSE) resulting in giant production of hyper-entangled photon-photon, plasmon-plasmon, and hybrid photon-plasmon states, far beyond what is feasible with extended monolayers or 3D geometries. We unravel these TPSE channels and show how their distinct Fano and Lorentzian spectral line-shapes provide a fingerprint to resolve photon-photon and photon-plasmon pathways via standard far-field single-photon spectroscopy measurements. We further show customization of the emitted two-quanta spectrum by actively tailoring the nanostructures’ optical response. We demonstrate that single photon generation via two-quanta photonic transitions can be orders of magnitude more efficient than standard one-photon spontaneous emission due to the high amplification of the photon-plasmon decay channel offered by the dark-modes supported in the nanostructure. The enormous field confinement of our ultrathin nanostructures also severely impacts the usual unbalance between one- and two-quanta emission rates, allowing the latter to be competitive with the former.\n","tags":null,"title":"Tailoring two-photon spontaneous emission using atomically thin plasmonic nanostructures","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Yuri Muniz","F.

O fenômeno consiste no decaimento de um emissor quântico excitado (por exemplo átomos ou moléculas), mesmo quando ele está isolado de todos os outros corpos no Universo, pela emissão de um ou mais fótons. Trata-se de um fenômeno cuja explicação mais adequada se dá no contexto da eletrodinâmica quântica (EDQ). Em 1946, Edward Mills Purcell mostrou que, ao contrário do que se imaginava na época, o tempo de vida de um emissor não é uma propriedade intrínseca do emissor, mas pode ser substancialmente alterado pela presença de corpos na vizinhança do mesmo. Por esse motivo, a influência de corpos na taxa de EE ficou conhecida como efeito Purcell. Esta dissertação tem como objetivo fazer uma revisão detalhada sobre EE de um fóton e o efeito Purcell, além de fazer um estudo de base do efeito Purcell na EE de dois fótons (EEDF), assunto muito pouco explorado na literatura.\n","tags":["Eletrodinâmica quântica","Emissão espontânea","Emissão de dois fótons","Efeito Purcell"],"title":"Efeito Purcell na emissão espontânea de um e dois fótons (Master thesis)","type":"publication"}]
